# Verifying The Project

Use the shared verifier for local checks and CI parity:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ".[desktop,security,dev]"
python scripts/verify.py
```

The full verifier runs:

- `python -m compileall src tests scripts`;
- `python scripts/check_docs.py` for local Markdown links, required release docs and English/Turkish README snippet consistency;
- `python -m pytest -q`;
- a CLI smoke test in a temporary `ROW_HOME`, including init, profile listing, example SSH dry-run, doctor JSON, and feature coverage output.

For dependency-constrained environments, run:

```bash
python scripts/verify.py --quick
```

Quick mode skips `pytest` and runs stdlib-backed compile checks, docs consistency and the CLI smoke test. It is useful for sandboxed review environments, but it is not a substitute for the full verifier before a release or pull request.

Optional linting is available when the dev extra is installed:

```bash
python scripts/verify.py --lint
```
